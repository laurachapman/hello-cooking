Hello cooking is an app that grabs Hello Fresh's latest recipes and sends a consolidated shopping list to your email. 

## Installation
Clone the directory on your personal machine:

and follow the prompts. 

## Note
You'll need to have an email address with less secure apps enabled to run this project. I recommend using a throwaway email rather than a personal one.
