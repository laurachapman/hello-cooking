# hello-cooking

Hello cooking is an app that grabs Hello Fresh's latest recipes and sends a consolidated shopping list to your email. 

## Installation
Clone the directory on your personal machine:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:laurachapman/hello-cooking.git
```

Install the dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```

## Running
From your hello-cooking directory, run
```bash
python main.py
```
and follow the prompts. 

## Note
You'll need to have an email address with less secure apps enabled to run this project. I recommend using a throwaway email rather than a personal one.
